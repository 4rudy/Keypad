# Keypad
The source code is from https://github.com/agacproject/agac-keypad

- Downsized and moved the keypad
- Changed the theme
- Removed password formart (now able to see what's being typed)
- Allowed use of letters and capitalization for "complex" passwords
- Script now returns the result instead of waiting for a callback
